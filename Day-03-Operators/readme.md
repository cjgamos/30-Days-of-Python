# üìò Day 3
## Boolean
A boolean data type represents one of the two values: *True or False*.  The use of these data types will be clear once we start using the comparison operator. The first letter T for True and F for False should be capital unlike JavaScript. **Example:Boolean Values**
```python
print(True)
print(False)
```
## Operators:
Python language supports several types of operators. In this section, we will focus on few of them.

### Assignment Operators:
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Let's take = as an example. Equal sign in mathematics shows that two values are equal, however in python it means we are storing a value in a certain variable and we call it assignment or assigning value to a variable. The table below shows the different types of python assignment operators.

### Arithmetic Operators:
* Addition(+): a + b
* Subtraction(-): a - b
* Multiplication(*): a * b
* Division(/): a / b
* Modulus(%): a % b
* Floor Division(//): a // b
* Exponentiation(**): a ** b
