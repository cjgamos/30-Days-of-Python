# üìò Day 4

## Strings
Text is a string data type. Any data type written as text is a string. Any data under single or double quote are strings. There are different string methods and built-in functions to deal with string data types. To check the length of a string use the len() method.

## Creating a String
```python
letter = 'P'                # A string could be a single character or a bunch of texts
print(letter)               # P
print(len(letter))          # 1
greeting = 'Hello, World!'  # String could be  a single or double quote,"Hello, World!"
print(greeting)             # Hello, World!
print(len(greeting))        # 13
sentence = "I hope you are enjoying the python Challenge"
print(sentence)
```
Multiline string is created by using triple single (''') or double quotes ("""). See the example below.
```python
multiline_string = '''I am a teacher and enjoy teaching.
I didn't find anything as rewarding as empowering people.
That is why I created this.'''
print(multiline_string)
# Another way of doing the same thing
multiline_string = """I am a teacher and enjoy teaching.
I didn't find anything as rewarding as empowering people.
That is why I created this."""
print(multiline_string)
```
## String Concatenation

We can connect strings together. Merging or connecting strings is called concatenation. See the example below:

```python
first_name = 'Carl'
last_name = 'Gamos'
space = ' '
full_name = first_name  +  space + last_name
print(full_name) # Carl Gamos
# Checking length of a string using len() built-in function
print(len(first_name))  # 8
print(len(last_name))   # 7
print(len(first_name) > len(last_name)) # True
print(len(full_name)) # 16
```
## Escape Sequences in Strings
In python and other programming languages \ followed by a character. Let's see the most common escape characters:

* \n: new line
* \t: Tab means(8 spaces)
* \\\\\: Back slash
* \\': Single quote (')
* \\": Double quote (")

```python
print('I hope everyone is enjoying the Python Challenge.\nAre you ?') # line break
print('Days\tTopics\tExercises')
print('Day 1\t3\t5')
print('Day 2\t3\t5')
print('Day 3\t3\t5')
print('Day 4\t3\t5')
print('This is a backslash  symbol (\\)') # To write a backslash
print('In every programming language it starts with \"Hello, World!\"')

# output
I hope every one is enjoying the Python Challenge.
Are you ?
Days	Topics	Exercises
Day 1	5	    5
Day 2	6	    20
Day 3	5	    23
Day 4	1	    35
This is a backslash  symbol (\)
In every programming language it starts with "Hello, World!"
```
## String Formatting
### Old Style String Formating (% Operator)
In python there are many ways of formating strings. In this section we will cover some of them. The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s", "%d", "%f", "%.f".
* %s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)
* %d - Integers
* %f - Floating point numbers
* %.f - Floating point numbers with fixed precision
```python
# Strings only
first_name = 'Carl'
last_name = 'Gamos'
language = 'Python'
formated_string = 'I am %s %s. I teach %s' %(first_name, last_name, language)
print(formated_string)

# Strings  and numbers
radius = 10
pi = 3.14
area = pi * radius ** 2
formated_string = 'The area of circle with a radius %d is %.2f.' %(radius, area) # 2 refers the 2 significant digits after the point

python_libraries = ['Django', 'Flask', 'Numpy', 'Pandas']
formated_string = 'The following are python libraries:%s' % (python_libraries)
print(formated_string) # "The following are python libraries:['Django', 'Flask', 'Numpy', 'Pandas']"
```

**New Style String Formating (str.format)**

This formating is introduced in python version 3.
```python
first_name = 'Carl'
last_name = 'Gamos'
language = 'Python'
formated_string = 'I am {} {}. I teach {}'.format(first_name, last_name, language)
print(formated_string)
a = 4
b = 3

print('{} + {} = {}'.format(a, b, a + b))
print('{} - {} = {}'.format(a, b, a - b))
print('{} * {} = {}'.format(a, b, a * b))
print('{} / {} = {:.2f}'.format(a, b, a / b)) # limits it to two digits after decimal
print('{} % {} = {}'.format(a, b, a % b))
print('{} // {} = {}'.format(a, b, a // b))
print('{} ** {} = {}'.format(a, b, a ** b))

# output
4 + 3 = 7
4 - 3 = 1
4 * 3 = 12
4 / 3 = 1.33
4 % 3 = 1
4 // 3 = 1
4 ** 3 = 64

# Strings  and numbers
radius = 10
pi = 3.14
area = pi * radius ** 2
formated_string = 'The area of a cricle with a radius {} is {:.2f}.'.format(radius, area) # 2 digits after decimal
print(formated_string)
```
### String Interpolation / f-Strings (Python 3.6+)
Another new string formating is string interpolation, f-strings. Strings start with f and we can inject the data in their corresponding positions.
```python
a = 4
b = 3
print(f'{a} + {b} = {a +b}')
print(f'{a} - {b} = {a - b}')
print(f'{a} * {b} = {a * b}')
print(f'{a} / {b} = {a / b:.2f}')
print(f'{a} % {b} = {a % b}')
print(f'{a} // {b} = {a // b}')
print(f'{a} ** {b} = {a ** b}')
```
## Python Strings as Sequences of Characters
Python strings are sequences of characters, and share their basic methods of access with other Python ordered sequences of objects ‚Äì lists and tuples. The simplest way of extracting single characters from strings (and individual members from any sequence) is to unpack them into corresponding variables.

### Unpacking Characters
```
language = 'Python'
a,b,c,d,e,f = language # unpacking sequence characters into variables
print(a) # P
print(b) # y
print(c) # t
print(d) # h
print(e) # o
print(f) # n
```
### Accessing Characters in Strings by Index   
In programming counting starts from zero. Therefore the first letter of a string is at zero index and the last letter of a string is the length of a string minus one.

```
['P', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']
  0    1    2    3    4    5 
```
```python
language = 'Python'
first_letter = language[0]
print(first_letter) # P
second_letter = language[1]
print(second_letter) # y
last_index = len(language) - 1
last_letter = language[last_index]
print(last_letter) # n
```
If we want to start from right end we can use negative indexing. -1 is the last index.
```python
language = 'Python'
last_letter = language[-1]
print(last_letter) # n
second_last = language[-2]
print(second_last) # o
```
### Slicing Python Strings
In python we can slice strings into substrings.
```python
language = 'Python'
first_three = language[0:3] # starts at zero index and up to 3 but not include 3
last_three = language[3:6]
print(last_three) # hon
# Another way
last_three = language[-3:]
print(last_three)   # hon
last_three = language[3:]
print(last_three)   # hon
```
### Reversing a string
We can easily reverse strings in python.
```python
greeting = 'Hello, World!'
print(greeting[::-1]) # !dlroW ,olleH
```
### Skipping Characters While Slicing
It is possible to skip characters while slicing by passing step argument to slice method.
```python
language = 'Python'
pto = language[0,6:2] #
print(pto) # Pto
```
## String Methods
There are many string methods which allow us to format strings. See some of the string methods in the following example:

* capitalize(): Converts the first character of the string to capital Letter
```python
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.capitalize()) # 'Thirty days of python'
```
