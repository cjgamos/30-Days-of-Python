# 📘 Day 1

## Introduction

Python is a high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. This is a 30 days python challenge, in where i am going to 
challenge myself to re-learn python for a month. I am going to use Python 3. I've broken down the topics into 30 days, where each day
contains several topics, explanations, real-world examples and hands on exercises.

This is just a learning purpose repository. Feel free to fork it.

## Why Python ? 

Python was my very first language, and it is easy to learn and easy to use. It is used by various industries and companies (Google, Facebook, Instagram, Etc.).
It has been used to develop web applications, system adminstration, desktop applications, and specially machine learning and data science. It is embraced in 
Data science and Machine learning community. 

## Python

### Python Shell

Python is an interpreted scripting language, so it doesn't need to be compiled. It executes the code line by line. When you enter the code, 
it interprets the code and shows the result in the next line. Open your terminal or command prompt(cmd) and write:

```python
python
```

The python interactive shell is opened and it is waiting for you to write some codes. Lets write our very first code on the python shell.

```python
>>> 2 + 3
5
```
