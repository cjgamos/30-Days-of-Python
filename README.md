# 📘 Day 1

## Introduction

Python is a high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. This is a 30 days python challenge, in where i am going to 
challenge myself to re-learn python for a month. I am going to use Python 3. I've broken down the topics into 30 days, where each day
contains several topics, explanations, real-world examples and hands on exercises.

This is just for learning purposes repository. 

## Why Python ? 

Python was my very first language, and it is easy to learn and easy to use. It is used by various industries and companies (Google, Facebook, Instagram, Etc.).
It has been used to develop web applications, system adminstration, desktop applications, and specially machine learning and data science. It is embraced in 
Data science and Machine learning community. 

## Python

### Python Shell

Python is an interpreted scripting language, so it doesn't need to be compiled. It executes the code line by line. When you enter the code, 
it interprets the code and shows the result in the next line. Open your terminal or command prompt(cmd) and write:

```python
python
```
The python interactive shell is opened and it is waiting for you to write some codes. Lets write our very first code on the python shell.
```python
>>> 2 + 3
5
```
In order for you to exit the interactive shell write **exit()** command and press Enter.
```python
exit()
```
>Now, we know how to open and exit the interactive shell. Python will give you results if you write scripts that python understands, if not it returns errors.

Let's practice more how to use python interactive shell. Go to your terminal or command prompt(cmd) and write the word **python**.

The python interactive shell is opened. Let's do some basic mathematic operations (addtion, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, expponential). Lets do some
maths first before we write any python code:

* 1 + 1 = 2
* 5 - 2 = 3
* 2 * 4 = 8 
* 5 / 2  = 2.5
* 3 ** 2 = 9

In python we have the following additional operations:

* 5 % 3 = 2-> means finding the remainder
* 3 // 2 = 1 -> means removing the remainder

Open the python interactive shell and lets write a comment at the very beginning of the shell. A *comment* is a part of the code that the python won't execute. 
We can leave a reminder or text in our code to make our code more readable. Python won't run the comment part. In order for us to comment in python it should 
start with a hash (#) symbol. Example of a comment: 
```
# This is a comment
# Be sure to start with a hash
```

Sample code:

```python 
>>> 1 + 1 # addition(+)
2
>>> 5 - 2 # subtractio(-)
3
>>> 2 * 4 # multiplication(*)
8
>>> 5 / 2 # division(/)
2.5
>>> 5 % 3 # Modulus(%) - finding the remainder
2
>>> 3 % 5 # Modulus(%) - finding the remainder
3
